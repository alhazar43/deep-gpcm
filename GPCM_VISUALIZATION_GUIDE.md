# GPCM Probabilistic Visualization Guide

## Overview

This guide presents enhanced visualization approaches for GPCM probability predictions that showcase the model's probabilistic understanding rather than forcing hard categorical matches. The new visualizations address fundamental limitations of traditional "hard matching" approaches in educational assessment contexts.

## Theoretical Foundation

### Problem with Hard Categorical Matching

**Original Issue:**
- Traditional visualization: Show only P(predicted_category = true_category)
- Creates misleading representation of model capability
- Ignores ordinal nature of educational proficiency categories
- Fails to capture model uncertainty and confidence

**Educational Assessment Context:**
- Categories: 0=Below Basic, 1=Basic, 2=Proficient, 3=Advanced
- Represent ordered proficiency levels on a continuum
- Students near boundaries should show mixed probabilities
- "Close" predictions (e.g., predicting 2 when truth is 3) should be valued differently than "far" predictions (e.g., predicting 0 when truth is 3)

### Theoretical Justification for Softer Approaches

1. **Ordinal Structure**: GPCM models ordinal responses with meaningful proximity relationships
2. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Models naturally express uncertainty through probability distributions
3. **IRT Theory Alignment**: Consistent with Samejima's Graded Response Model and Muraki's GPCM emphasis on smooth transitions
4. **Educational Measurement**: Proficiency exists on a continuum; categories are convenience bins

## Enhanced Visualization Approaches

### 1. Expected Ordinal Score (Default Recommendation)

**Concept:** Calculate expected ordinal score using full probability distribution
```
Expected Score = Σ(k × P(category=k)) for k ∈ {0,1,2,3}
```

**Advantages:**
- Accounts for complete probability distribution
- Single interpretable metric per response (0-3 scale)
- Rewards "close" predictions appropriately
- Natural ordinal interpretation
- Smooth gradients reveal learning patterns

**Visualization:** Viridis colormap (0-3 scale) showing progression from novice to expert

### 2. Prediction Confidence

**Concept:** Show maximum probability across all categories
```
Confidence = max(P(category=k)) for k ∈ {0,1,2,3}
```

**Advantages:**
- Reveals model certainty vs. uncertainty
- Identifies confident vs. hesitant predictions
- Helps distinguish well-calibrated from overconfident models
- Useful for identifying boundary cases

**Visualization:** Red-Yellow-Green colormap highlighting confident predictions

### 3. Ordinal Distance-Weighted Accuracy

**Concept:** Weight accuracy by ordinal distance, giving partial credit for near misses
```
Weighted Accuracy = Σ(weight[|true_category - k|] × P(category=k))
where weights = [1.0, 0.75, 0.25, 0.0] for distances [0,1,2,3]
```

**Advantages:**
- Incorporates ground truth for validation
- Penalizes distant errors more than close ones
- Provides fair assessment of ordinal prediction quality
- Aligns with educational measurement principles

**Visualization:** Red-Yellow-Blue colormap emphasizing ordinal accuracy

### 4. Entropy-Based Confidence

**Concept:** Measure prediction uncertainty using Shannon entropy
```
Entropy = -Σ(P(category=k) × log(P(category=k)))
Confidence = 1 - (Entropy / max_possible_entropy)
```

**Advantages:**
- Information-theoretic foundation
- Captures distributional uncertainty
- Identifies ambiguous vs. clear-cut cases
- Useful for active learning and model analysis

**Visualization:** Plasma colormap highlighting certainty patterns

## Implementation Features

### Multi-Perspective Analysis

The implementation provides four complementary visualizations:
1. **gpcm_probs_heatmap.png**: Expected scores (default, recommended for papers)
2. **gpcm_confidence.png**: Maximum probability confidence
3. **gpcm_ordinal_accuracy.png**: Distance-weighted accuracy
4. **gpcm_entropy_confidence.png**: Entropy-based confidence
5. **gpcm_comprehensive.png**: 4-panel comparison view

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Generate all probabilistic visualizations
python analysis/irt_analysis.py --dataset synthetic_500_200_4 --analysis_types temporal

# Default visualization uses expected scores (recommended)
# Individual perspectives available for detailed analysis
```

### Key Improvements Over Hard Matching

1. **Reveals Model Strengths**: Shows sophisticated probabilistic reasoning
2. **Educational Relevance**: Aligns with continuous proficiency theory
3. **Ordinal Awareness**: Respects category ordering and proximity
4. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Captures model confidence levels
5. **Research Utility**: Better represents model capabilities for academic presentation

## Academic Presentation Guidelines

### For Conferences and Papers

**Recommended Primary Visualization:**
- Use **Expected Ordinal Scores** as main figure
- Shows complete probabilistic understanding
- Single, interpretable metric
- Smooth gradients reveal learning patterns

**Supporting Analysis:**
- Include confidence analysis to show uncertainty patterns
- Use ordinal-weighted accuracy for validation against ground truth
- Present 4-panel comprehensive view in appendix

**Key Messages to Emphasize:**
1. Models demonstrate sophisticated probabilistic reasoning beyond hard classification
2. Ordinal structure is respected through appropriate weighting
3. Uncertainty quantification provides insights into model reliability
4. Temporal dynamics capture learning trajectories not visible in static IRT

### Interpretation Guidelines

**Expected Scores (0-3 scale):**
- Dark blue (0-1): Below Basic to Basic proficiency
- Green-Yellow (1-2): Basic to Proficient transition
- Bright yellow (2-3): Proficient to Advanced progression

**Confidence Patterns:**
- High confidence in stable proficiency regions
- Lower confidence near category boundaries
- Learning transitions show uncertainty spikes

**Ordinal Accuracy Validation:**
- High values indicate good ordinal prediction quality
- Patterns reveal systematic vs. random prediction errors
- Useful for model validation and comparison

## Metrics and Complementary Analysis

### Quantitative Metrics

1. **Mean Expected Score Accuracy**: How close expected scores are to true categories
2. **Ordinal Distance Distribution**: Frequency of prediction distances
3. **Confidence-Accuracy Relationship**: Calibration analysis
4. **Entropy-Performance Correlation**: Uncertainty vs. accuracy patterns

### Temporal Analysis Integration

- Shows how probabilistic understanding evolves over time
- Reveals learning trajectories and ability development
- Captures dynamic uncertainty patterns during skill acquisition
- Demonstrates temporal parameter evolution (α, β) → probability changes

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Student Selection Strategy
- Uses model-averaged hit rates for consistent visualization
- Selects students across performance spectrum (quartile-based)
- Ensures comparable analysis across different models
- 20-student sample provides good representation without clutter

### Colormap Choices
- **Viridis**: Expected scores (perceptually uniform, colorblind-friendly)
- **RdYlGn**: Confidence measures (intuitive red=low, green=high)
- **RdYlBu**: Ordinal accuracy (blue=high accuracy, red=low)
- **Plasma**: Entropy measures (magenta=high confidence, yellow=uncertain)

### Scale Considerations
- Expected scores: 0-3 ordinal scale
- Probabilities: 0-1 continuous scale
- Consistent scaling enables cross-model comparison
- Adaptive ranges based on actual data distribution
