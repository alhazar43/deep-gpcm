# Phase 3 Cleanup Log

**Date**: 2025-08-13  
**Branch**: cleanup-phase3  
**Files Moved**: 2 model implementations
**Space Saved**: 36KB  
**Risk Level**: Medium - Model implementations removed

## Files Moved to tmp_cleanup/phase3/

### Unused Model Implementations
- `models/implementations/temporal_attention_gpcm.py` - Legacy temporal attention model
- `models/implementations/fixed_temporal_attention_gpcm.py` - Legacy fixed temporal attention model

### Analysis Results
**CRITICAL FINDING**: Original cleanup plan was **WRONG** about analysis tools:
- `utils/irt_utils.py` - **ESSENTIAL** - Used by IRT analysis pipeline
- `utils/monitoring.py` - **ESSENTIAL** - Used by prediction system
- These files were **NOT MOVED** - they are core functionality

### Registry Updates
- Updated `models/factory.py` to comment out imports for moved temporal models
- Models were already commented out in registry, confirming they were unused
- Only `stable_temporal_attn_gpcm` remains active (the production-ready version)

## Risk Assessment & Validation
- **Risk Level**: Medium - removed model implementations
- **Model Factory**: ✅ Valid Python syntax maintained
- **Core Scripts**: ✅ train.py, main.py, evaluate.py all valid
- **Essential Models**: ✅ All active models preserved:
  - `deep_gpcm` ✅
  - `attn_gpcm_learn` ✅  
  - `attn_gpcm_linear` ✅
  - `stable_temporal_attn_gpcm` ✅
- **Import Structure**: ✅ All remaining model files exist

## Conservative Approach Applied
- Only moved models that were:
  1. Imported but commented out in registry (indicating legacy status)
  2. No active references in current codebase
  3. Superseded by newer versions (stable_temporal_attn_gpcm)
- **Preserved all analysis tools** after discovering they are essential

## Safety Protocol Applied
- All files MOVED (not deleted) to enable easy restoration
- Factory imports commented (not removed) for documentation
- Core training/evaluation pipeline fully preserved

## Validation Results
- **Python Syntax**: ✅ All remaining code has valid syntax
- **Import Dependencies**: ✅ All model imports point to existing files
- **Core Functionality**: ✅ Essential scripts and utilities preserved
- **Model Registry**: ✅ Active models unchanged and functional

## Total Cleanup Progress
- **Phase 1**: 941MB (backups, cache, artifacts)
- **Phase 2**: 564KB (experimental scripts)  
- **Phase 3**: 36KB (unused model implementations)
- **Total**: ~941MB space saved with enhanced code clarity

## Recommendations
- System should function normally for all training/evaluation tasks
- Moved temporal models can be restored if needed for research/comparison
- Phase 4 (architectural improvements) available for further optimization
