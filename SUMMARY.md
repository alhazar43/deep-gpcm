## Project Overview

Deep-GPCM is a production-ready knowledge tracing system that integrates modern neural memory networks with classical psychometric models to predict polytomous response patterns in educational assessment. The project bridges the gap between deep learning and Item Response Theory (IRT) by combining Dynamic Key-Value Memory Networks (DKVMN) with Generalized Partial Credit Models (GPCM) for ordinal response prediction.

### Problem Domain and Applications

The system addresses knowledge tracing in educational technology, specifically:

## IRT Analysis Integration

### Item Response Theory Foundation

The system implements full IRT parameter extraction within the neural framework:

**Student Ability (θ)**: `θ = tanh(ability_network(summary)) * ability_scale`
- Bounded between [-scale, scale] for numerical stability
- Represents latent proficiency at each time step
- Enables individual learning trajectory analysis

**Item Discrimination (α)**: `α = softplus(discrimination_network(summary, question)) + 0.1`
- Positive constraint ensures valid psychometric interpretation
- Indicates how well items differentiate between students
- Context-dependent based on temporal question embedding

**Threshold Parameters (β)**: Monotonic ordering via cumulative softplus
- Ensures valid ordinal category boundaries
- Centered around zero for interpretability
- Supports any number of response categories (2-5+)
