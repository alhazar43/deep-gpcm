## Project: VRec/deep-gpcm

### Overview

The `deep-gpcm` project is a research-focused implementation of a **Deep Generalized Partial Credit Model (Deep-GPCM)** for knowledge tracing. It extends the concepts of Deep-IRT to handle polytomous (multi-category) responses, which is crucial for educational scenarios involving partial credit or ordered performance levels. The model is built upon a **Dynamic Key-Value Memory Network (DKVMN)** and uses a GPCM-based predictor to estimate student knowledge.

### Key Features

*   **Generalized Partial Credit Model (GPCM):** Implements a psychometrically-grounded model for predicting performance across multiple ordered categories (e.g., scores from 0 to 3).
*   **Multiple Embedding Strategies:** The model supports several strategies for encoding student responses, allowing for flexible representation of knowledge acquisition:
    *   `ordered`: Treats responses as continuous values.
    *   `unordered`: Treats each response category independently.
    *   `linear_decay`: A weighted approach that gives more importance to responses closer to the true answer.
*   **Ordinal Loss Function:** Utilizes a custom `OrdinalLoss` that respects the inherent order of the response categories, leading to more accurate training for ordinal data compared to standard cross-entropy.
*   **Advanced Evaluation Metrics:** The project includes a comprehensive suite of metrics tailored for ordinal data, such as:
    *   `categorical_accuracy`: Exact match accuracy.
    *   `ordinal_accuracy`: Accuracy within a tolerance of Â±1 category.
    *   `quadratic_weighted_kappa`: Measures inter-rater agreement for categorical items.
    *   `prediction_consistency_accuracy`: A novel metric to ensure predictions are consistent with the ordinal nature of the training loss.
    *   `ordinal_ranking_accuracy`: Measures the correlation between predicted and true rankings.
*   **Comprehensive Analysis Tools:** The repository contains scripts for training, cross-validation, evaluation, and comparing different embedding strategies.

### Architecture

The core architecture of the `DeepGpcmModel` is as follows:

1.  **Input:** A sequence of (question, response) pairs.
2.  **Embedding:** The input is transformed into a high-dimensional representation using one of the available embedding strategies.
3.  **DKVMN:** The embedded input is processed by a DKVMN, which maintains a memory of the student's knowledge state.
4.  **GPCM Predictor:** The DKVMN's output is fed into a GPCM predictor, which calculates the probability distribution over the K response categories for the next question. This involves estimating the student's ability (`theta`), the question's discrimination (`alpha`), and the difficulty thresholds (`betas`) for each category.
5.  **Output:** The model outputs the predicted response probabilities.

### Implementation Status

The project is well-developed and appears to be in the experimental and validation phase.
