# Deep-GPCM Migration Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Directory Reorganization
- Renamed `core/` to `models/` to better reflect its purpose
- Created logical subdirectories:
  - `models/base/` - Base classes and interfaces
  - `models/implementations/` - Concrete model implementations
  - `models/components/` - Reusable components (memory networks, embeddings, etc.)
  - `models/adaptive/` - Adaptive blending mechanisms

### 2. File Reorganization
- Split monolithic files into focused modules
- Moved classes to appropriate locations based on their purpose
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing imports

### 3. Import Fixes
- Updated all imports throughout the project to use new structure
- Fixed missing imports discovered during testing:
  - `torch.nn.functional as F` in deep_gpcm.py
  - Attention components imports in attention_gpcm.py
  - Type hints and model imports in coral_gpcm.py
  - CORAL model imports in evaluate.py

### 4. Individual Fold Results Saving
- Fixed indentation issue in train.py (lines 726-749)
- Individual fold training results now saved as separate JSON files
- Enables detailed plotting and analysis of per-fold performance

## Current Status

### Working Models
- ✅ deep_gpcm - Baseline GPCM model
- ✅ attn_gpcm - Attention-enhanced GPCM
- ✅ coral_gpcm - CORAL-integrated GPCM
- ✅ full_adaptive_coral_gpcm - Fully adaptive CORAL GPCM

### Removed Models
- ❌ ecoral_gpcm - No longer exists (removed from codebase)

### Key Files Modified
1. `migrate_core_to_models.py` - Migration script (can be deleted if no longer needed)
2. `train.py` - Fixed fold saving indentation
3. `evaluate.py` - Updated CORAL imports
4. `main.py` - Removed ecoral_gpcm from model choices
5. All model files - Updated imports to new structure

## Benefits of New Structure

1. **Clarity**: Directory names now match their contents
2. **Organization**: Related components grouped together
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify specific components
4. **Extensibility**: Clear structure for adding new models or components

## Testing Results

All models tested successfully with:
- 5-fold cross-validation
- 5 epochs of training
- Individual fold results saved correctly
- Model evaluation and plotting working

The migration has been completed successfully with all functionality preserved and improved organization.
